use an api to fetch a list of cocktails
store in a db.json file
use javascript to manipulate the DOM
Create a form that allows users to enter their own cocktails -> event listener "submit"
Create a system to record likes -> button -> event listener "click"
I want the button to be on each cocktail
I want it to record increment the total likes
I want it to update the UI to reflect new like count
Create an event that has a dropdown that has alcohol in it, when user selects the alcohol in the dropdown - the array of cocktails
rendered is only the cocktails that have those ingredients and the rest are hidden -> event listener "change"
