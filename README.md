My phase 1 final project

Project Status: this is a project for a software engineering course, it is beginner in nature and has further development required before it is complete.

Name:
Candy T's Cocktails - cocktail database, add, rate, filter.

Description
This is a database hosted on json server, it allows the user to
-enter submit cocktails to the database\*
users can enter a name, an img link ingredients, measures and also instructions to the database.
-to filter by ingredient
-to like or dislike the cocktails.

\*The submission functionality is not complete as the opportunity to edit submissions has not been built yet. This means mistakes cannot easily be corrected, for any corrections please email "corrections@candytcocktails.com", there is also no functionality to avoid duplicate drinks being entered to the database, or any rules around unitos of measurement. As the boxes are all free text boxes the opportunity exists for random text to be entered.

Installation
you will need to run:
json 10.2.4

Support
For help go to "corrections@candytcocktails.com",

Roadmap
in future releases - a login and password requirement will be added, option to edit entries - but only the entries that the logged in user has made, toggle between metric and imperial units of measure.
